## CMSIS device headers for STM32

This folder includes the CMSIS device headers for all STM32 devices.
The files located here are part of the `STM32Cube` libraries and can be found inside the `STM32Cube*/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F*xx/Include` folder.  

The files are copied and modified by converting all line endings from Windows to Unix style and removing all trailing whitespace (see `post_script.sh`). If you don't like that, stop complaining and do the work yourself.

Here is the list of the current device header version and release date as well as the Cube release version in braces:

The Travis CI integration checks these versions daily and will fail, if they need updating: [![](https://travis-ci.org/modm-io/cmsis-header-stm32.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/modm-io/cmsis-header-stm32)
