The modm framework consists of powerful hardware abstraction layers for many
different microcontrollers, a set of drivers for various external targets and a general purpose toolbox for building hardware orientated applications.

The main goal of modm is to provide a usable API for barebone microcontroller programming,
which is efficient enough to be deployed on a small ATtiny, yet powerful enough to make
use of advanced capabilities found on the 32bit ARM Cortex-M.

modm is [battle-tested](#who-we-are) in the real-world, highly competitive
environment of [Eurobot][].
It is the foundation of all of [@RCA_eV][rca]'s robot code, and is the
culmination of many years worth of effort, experience and improvements.

All of these targets are compiling and booting correctly
(&#9733;)
and have GPIO and UART working
(&#9733;&#9733;).
Most targets have support for basic peripherals, like I2C, SPI and ADC
(&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;)
as well as complicated peripherals, like Timers, CAN and external memory
(&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).
We also use a few targets in everyday development, which are very well tested
(&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).

Please see [our examples for a complete list][examples] of tested projects.

### Your target

While the modm API is designed to be portable, we are only a small team of developers and are limited in the amount of platforms we can support and test in hardware.
The following microcontrollers should be able to compile, but *have not been tested extensively* in hardware:

- All AT90 targets
- All ATtiny targets
- All ATmega targets
- All STM32F0 targets
- All STM32F1 targets
- All STM32F3 targets
- All STM32F4 targets
- All STM32F7 targets

There are more platforms which we have prepared, but currently not finished support for (Xmega, STM32F2, STM32L).
[Drop us an email][mailing_list] to ask if your specific target is supported out-of-the-box and what you can do if it's not.

## Documentation

The project homepage is located at [modm.io](http://modm.io).  
Complete installation instructions for our build system and toolchains can [be found here][install].

The API documentation is created from doxygen files in the doc-folder and can be found [online here](http://modm.io/api/modules.html).  
If you want to have up-to-date documentation of the develop branch, execute `scons doc`
in the modm root directory and the current development documentation will be available
in `modm/doc/build/api/index.html`.

modm also has [a blog for in-depth write ups][blog] of the programming techniques used.

## How can I contribute?

The easiest way for you and the best way for us to see if something is unclear or missing, is if you use the library and [give us some feedback](http://mailman.rwth-aachen.de/mailman/listinfo/modm-dev).

You may of course [file a bug report](https://github.com/roboterclubaachen/modm/issues) or if you have a fix already, [open a pull request](https://github.com/roboterclubaachen/modm/pulls).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for our contributing guidelines.

## Who we are

During the last decade the [Roboterclub Aachen e.V.][rca_ev] has developed a software library for communication among components that are distributed on PCs and microcontrollers. This library was used in autonomous robots for the [Eurobot competition][eurobot].

In 2009, modm became a separate project and since then focussed on a new approach to cross target microcontroller libraries. Over the years modm grew from a communication library to a general purpose framework suitable for all kinds of embedded applications.

The modm project is maintained by
Niklas Hauser ([@salkinium](https://github.com/salkinium)) with significant contributions from
Sascha Schade ([@strongly-typed](https://github.com/strongly-typed)),
Kevin LÃ¤ufer ([@ekiwi](https://github.com/ekiwi)),
Fabian Greif ([@dergraaf](https://github.com/dergraaf)),
Martin Rosekeit ([@thundernail](https://github.com/thundernail)),
Daniel Krebs ([@daniel-k](https://github.com/daniel-k)) and
Georgi Grinshpun ([@georgi-g](https://github.com/georgi-g)).

<dt>scons</dt>
<dd>
  SCons tools (e.g. modm.py for the build process, avr.py for compiling for
  AVR microcontrollers, arm.py for compiling for Cortex-M3/4, etc.)

  Look at the SConstruct files in the example folder and the online
  documentation to see how to use the provided scons tools.
