 * Peripheral class

 * This class acts as a base class for all classes describing the
 * public interface of common peripheral drivers.
 * As there is no implementation given, the classes specific to the platform
 * inherit from their respective base classes and must shadow the methods of
 * them.
 *
 * The inheritance is only visible for the documentation, it is completely
 * removed during compile time keeping a possible error at platform level.
 * This is safe, because only one platform can be compiled at once.
 *
 * This way, no virtual functions are needed and no overhead is generated,
 * but we still have clean inheritance in the documentation.
 * There is no need to document the platform specific implementation, since
 * it is taken from the base class.
