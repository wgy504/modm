/**
 * Generic software timeout class for variable timebase and timestamp width.
 *
 * This class allows for a signal to be generated after a period of time,
 * which can also be used to execute code once after timeout expiration.
 *
 * Its logic can be described by the following annotated waveform:
 *
 * - C: Default Constructor
 * - S: (Re-)Start timeout
 * - E: Timeout Expired
 * - H: Code handler (`execute()` returned `true`)
 * - P: Stop timeout
 *

Event:    C      S      E     H       P            S          E H

Expired:  ______________/             \_______________________/              ...

          _______                      ____________
Stopped:         \____________________/            \_________________________...

                              _                                 _

@endverbatim
 *
 * The default constructor initializes the timeout in the `Stopped` state,
 * in which `isExpired()` and `execute()` never return `true`.
 * If you need a timeout to expire immidiately after construction, you need
 * to explicitly initialize the constructor with time `0`, which has the
 * same behavior as `restart(0)`.
 *
 * If you want to execute code once after the timeout expired, poll the
 * `execute()` method, which returns `true` exactly once after expiration.
 *
 * @code
 * if (timeout.execute())
 * {
 *     // called once after timeout
 *     Led::toggle();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Be aware, however, that since this method is polled, it cannot execute
 * exactly at the time of expiration, but some time after expiration, as
 * indicated in the above waveform graph.
 *
 * @warning	Never use this class when a precise timebase is needed!
 *
 * The `remaining()` time until expiration is signed positive before, and
 * negative after expiration. This means `Clock::now() + Timeout::remaining()`
 * will yield the timestamp of the expiration.
 * If the timeout is stopped, `remaining()` returns zero.
 *
 *
 * @see		GenericPeriodicTimer
 *
 * @tparam	Clock
 * 		Used clock which inherits from modm::Clock, may have a variable timebase.
 * @tparam	TimestampType
 * 		Used timestamp which is compatible with the chosen Clock.
