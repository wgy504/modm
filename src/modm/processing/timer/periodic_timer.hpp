/**
 * Generic software timeout class for variable timebase and timestamp width.
 *
 * This class allows for periodic code execution
 *
 * Its logic can be described by the following annotated waveform:
 *
 * - C: Constructor
 * - S: (Re-)Start timer
 * - I: Period interval
 * - H: Code handler (`execute()` returned `true`)
 * - P: Stop timer
 *
@verbatim
Event:    C         IH        I         I  H      I  S    IH   I    IH  P
                     _         _____________       __      _    ______
Expired:  __________/ \_______/             \_____/  \____/ \__/      \____...
          __________   _______               _____    ____   __        _
Armed:              \_/       \_____________/     \__/    \_/  \______/ \__...
                                                                         __
Stopped:  ______________________________________________________________/  ...

                     _                     _               _         _
Handle:   __________/ \___________________/ \_____________/ \_______/ \____...

Remaining:     +    |0|   +   |     -     |0|  +  | -|  + |0| +| -  |0|+| 0
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you want to execute code once per period interval, poll the
 * `execute()` method, which returns `true` exactly once after expiration.
 *
 * @code
 * if (timer.execute())
 * {
 *     // periodically called once
 *     Led::toggle();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Be aware, however, that since this method is polled, it cannot execute
 * exactly at the time of expiration, but some time after expiration, as
 * indicated in the above waveform graph.
 * If one or several periods are missed when polling `execute()`, these
 * code executions are discarded and will not be cought up.
 * Instead, `execute()` returns `true` once and then reschedules itself
 * for the next period, without any period skewing.
 *
 * @warning	Never use this class when a precise timebase is needed!
 *
 * Notice, that the `PeriodicTimerState::Expired` is reset to
 * `PeriodicTimerState::Armed` only after `execute()` has returned `true`.
 * This is different to the behavior of GenericTimeout, where calls to
 * `GenericTimeout::execute()` have no impact on class state.
 *
 * The `remaining()` time until period expiration is signed positive before,
 * and negative after period expiration until `execute()` is called.
 * If the timer is stopped, `remaining()` returns zero.
 *
 * @see		GenericTimeout
 *
 * @tparam	Clock
 * 		Used clock which inherits from modm::Clock, may have a variable timebase.
 * @tparam	TimestampType
 * 		Used timestamp which is compatible with the chosen Clock.
